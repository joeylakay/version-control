When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like to collaborate with folks all over the world or when you don't want to store all your code on your machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because your local repo might have experimental features that you aren't ready to share with a larger audience.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: Github's way of cloning one user's repo into another user's...which preserves the commit history of original repo.

Clones:  Duplicating a repo, usually pulling down a master remote repo onto your local machine.

Branches:  Different commits on a single repo. When you want to make a change to the codebase, but preserve another branch for later use.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can track changes that collaborators made to the remote and then fetch in order to merge their changes into your local repo.
