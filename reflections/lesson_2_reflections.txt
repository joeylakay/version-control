What happens when you initialize a repository?

it adds the .git configuration file to the repo.


Why do you need to do it?

without the .git file, we won't be able to track changes in the repo using git.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The staging area is where you put files you are ready to add or remove to a commit

What value do you think it offers?

It's value is to allow you to make multiple changes to a variety of files that might be
contained in a conceptual change to the codebase.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Since a logical change can often incorporate many changes in several files, having a storehouse containing all those changes before commiting is handy.
